# Calculator-UI
C++ calculator UI using window's UI things. (32-bit)

EXE file is in Debug folder, have fun.

Feel free to critique my code.

The Calculator is very bare bones and have an issue when there are too many numbers. Otherwise it works but does lack a couple features that would make it slightly more user friendly.
