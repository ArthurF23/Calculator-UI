# Calculator-UI
C++ calculator UI using window's UI things. (32-bit)

EXE file is in Release folder, or the debug folder but i reccomend the release folder. Have fun!

Feel free to critique my code.

There is a bug that says VCRUNTIME140D.dll was not found, and im currently trying to fix it. I think it's because it was a debug version built in visual C++, so I built a release version to try and resolve that problem, although I am not certian that that is the issue or not.
